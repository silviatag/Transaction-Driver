# Transaction-Driver
a simple java project that includes a "BankAccount" class, "SavngsAccount" class, "CheckingAccount" class, and a "TransactionDriver" class which is the main class. The project uses the concept of inheritance where both "SavingsAccount" and "CheckingAccount" inherit from the "BankAccount" class. They have different functions that can deposit and withdraw money from an account as well as calculate transaction fees and interest rates. The "TransactionDriver" class which has the main function implements the functions of the different classes to show their output.
